Can you brainstorm and come up with a unique design for a past Paradox variant of the design in the image attached as depicted in Pokemon Scarlet/Violet? Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Feel free to be creative and reinterpret how this design would be adapted to another context!
