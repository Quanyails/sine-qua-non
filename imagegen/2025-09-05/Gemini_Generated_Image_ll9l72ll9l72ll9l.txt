Can you brainstorm and generate an image of the character in the image attached in the style of a 3D model from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet? Use contextual clues to add more depth to the piece beyond the subject itself. Draw the Pokemon as you might encounter it on the open-world map, optionally with a trainer about to start a battle encounter with it.
