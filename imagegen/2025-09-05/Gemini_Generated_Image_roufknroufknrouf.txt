Can you brainstorm and come up with a unique design for a Convergent Evolution of the design the image attached? Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Think about what a Pokemon that converges to the design could look like. Reinterpret this design to your liking. :)
