Can you brainstorm and come up with a design for a split evolution of the design in the image attached? Imagine that this Pokemon has a pre-evolved form, and that this pre-evolution can evolve either into Astrolotl or "something else" (AKA the thing you will be drawing). Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Be inventive and reinterpret this design to your liking. :)
