Can you brainstorm and come up with a unique design for a Create-a-Pokemon Project (CAP Project) variation of the design the image attached? Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Be inventive and reinterpret this design to your liking. :)

Note: CAP Project designs do not adhere to the same design principles as regular Pokemon do. If you don't know what these design look like, feel free to look them up.
