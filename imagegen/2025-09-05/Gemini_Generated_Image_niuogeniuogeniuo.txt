Can you brainstorm and come up with a unique design for a Mega Evolution of the design in the image attached? Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Feel free to reinterpret this design to your liking (i.e. don't just make it an adult/tougher-looking form of the reference design).
