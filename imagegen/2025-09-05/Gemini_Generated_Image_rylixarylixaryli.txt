Can you brainstorm and generate an image of a modern, 2020s-style anime screencap using design in the image attached? Use contextual clues to add more depth to the piece beyond the subject itself. Make sure the background is fully-illustrated. Feel free to add more Pokemon concepts to the illustration, including any of: a Pokemon trainer, other Pokemon, Pokemon attacks, etc. Be inventive and reinterpret this design to your liking. :)
