Can you brainstorm and come up with a design for a forme change for the design in the image attached? Before generating the image, think about what an inspired-looking forme change might entail for this design. Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Be inventive and reinterpret this design to your liking. :)
