Can you brainstorm and come up with a "Mythical Pixie" Pokemon design variant of the design in the image attached? Draw the image on a plain white background + in full color. Draw the design in the style of Ken Sugimori (the artist of Pokemon). Be inventive and reinterpret this design to your liking. :)
