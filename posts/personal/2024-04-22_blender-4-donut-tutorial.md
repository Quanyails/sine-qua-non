## Overview

Following the total solar eclipse of 2024-04-08, I was feeling particularly productive. Exploring a new city over multiple days refreshed my focus and improved my pace of life, which carried over post-eclipse.

Ever since my student copy of Autodesk Maya expired, I've been meaning to check out a replacement option. Furthermore, I was inspired by how some artists in CAP were able to use Blender to help define their submissions. As I still had a productivity bug, I decided to pick up Blender.

Google was helpful in finding high-quality resources. I found [a list of recommended sources](https://webapp4.asu.edu/bookstore/viewsyllabus/2211/34444) in the syllabus for a course at ASU, listing BlenderGuru (Andrew Price) as a non-optional resource. BlenderGuru is known for his "donut tutorial", which is widely recommended as an introduction to Blender. I had heard it recommended before, but it was only now I could consider it as a learning option.

Overall, the tutorial seemed effective. I was able to navigate through it from the first video to the last with only a few hurdles along the way. The video in this post depicts the final product of the tutorial.

## Design Notes

- This isn't the first time I tried getting into Blender. Previously, I tried getting into Blender when I wanted to accomplish a particular goal (e.g. modeling a character or setting a reference scene). Of course, since I only had experience with Maya to start, I wouldn't know where to begin. All of the tutorials used Blender-specific navigation, and none of them would lead me to my goal, anyway. In contrast, learning Blender without a specific goal in mind led to much more effective returns, as I was able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the software.
- Blender is a program that requires a number of prerequisites to truly make sense of. When navigating through the tutorial, I found I fell on prior experience in subjects such as: art, computer graphics, computer hardware, node-based workflows (e.g. ComfyUI), optics/photography, and software design. Years ago, I felt over my head trying to use the software. This time, however, I felt fully engaged.
- Given the berth of tool shortcuts and menu options the program offered, I feel like tackling Blender is its own, isolated skill set.

## Miscellaneous notes

- I skipped the following steps in BlenderGuru's tutorial: anything to do with logging into his website (adding custom materials, importing assets, adding an add-on), adding extra fancy sprinkles to the front donut.
- Whereas BlenderGuru used natural floating-point values when transforming or setting data, I preferred to snap values to one or two significant digits at best.
- BlenderGuru's tutorial does not cover rigging. While fine within the scope of the series, I will need to pursue other resources to learn how to rig a model in Blender.
- To memory, I've only interacted with video editing software once before this tutorial (Adobe Premiere for a course). Over the course of the tutorial, I picked up a smidge about video editing software through Blender's built-in video editor. While not its primary use case, Blender seems like a valid option for those learning about video editing.
