Disclaimer: This piece is a MIDI transcription first, learning experience second, and arrangement third, so there are sacrifices made to the quality of this track.

## Overview

At the time of writing, there is no MIDI transcription of Cynthia Gray's "River Song". Using the original sheet music as supplied [here](https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title//19749183), I transcribed the song into FL Studio.

## Design notes

Although I have the song as it is meant to be played in its entirety, I found that there were many places where I had much to learn in transcribing the song into a digital format:

- FL Studio is a [Quicksand Box](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox), where the program offers an incredible number of features but is lacking in direction. For a beginner, it can be daunting trying to perform a basic action. In my case, I wanted to load in a sampled instrument. Initially, I tried manually downloading VSTs, but I later discovered that there were standard plugins that composers used, such as Kontakt and SoundFont readers. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFH-Msj8fSg) from the In The Mix YouTube channel has been essential explaining not only what features are available in FL Studio but also what features newcomers should focus on.
- In western sheet music notation, a trill acts as an ornament on a single note. In digital audio production, this model does not hold; it seems there is no way to apply a trill to a note non-destructively. In the project file, I wrote the trill as a fast sequence of alternating notes.
- When mixing the track, some audio channels sounded muddy together. In learning how to make one channel stand out against the other, I learned about sidechaining. [This tutorial](https://djcity.com.au/blog/how-to-sidechain-in-fl-studio-20-step-by-step-tutorial/) gave me an excellent mental model of how sidechaining works. Ultimately, however, I didn't apply sidechaining to this track, instead using regular volume and velocity automation.
- "River Song" is sung, meaning that the instruments in the song retain the nuances of human speech. In transcribing the voiced parts to other instruments, I lost that nuance. It is possible to restore some nuance by using instruments with multiple articulations. However, I did not want to address this option for two reasons: 1. these instruments tend to be costly, and 2. I did not want to customize my environment with [BRSO Articulate](https://www.syntheticorchestra.com/tools/articulate/) until I was better acquainted with the program.

## Miscellaneous

Unfortunately, since Tumblr lacks the ability to host files of arbitrary file type, I am not able to share the original project file on this website. If there is interest in the original FL Studio project file or MIDI, please send me a message, including a motivation for the request.
