## Unsorted comments

- Favorite analysis video: [The Best Rhymes in Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBtzjhFo54)
- Favorite animatic: [You'll Be Back \|\| Hamilton Animatic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn5e7vq5bqk)
- Favorite track: "Yorktown" (see: instrumental break)
- Vocabulary: homily, _loco parentis_, [sitzprobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZa9TkoREg8)
- Comment: Considering its source material, musical genre(s), and lyrical density, _Hamilton_ is uniquely American. Anyone interested in learning American English + culture should seek _Hamilton_ as a boss level.
- Comment: The less you know about American history, the more the play works as a standalone story.
- Comment: With his obscene control over the English language, Lin Manuel Miranda really is a modern-day Shakespeare.
- Comment: "Yorktown" not even being the Act I climax surprised me the first time I saw the performance. I would have thought the Revolutionary War would have been more of a climactic element of the performance, but it acts more like a stepping stone towards the play's true narrative.
- Comment: If Angelica is the sharpest of the Schuyler sisters, shouldn't she have figured that Hamilton would have fallen from grace like Icarus to save Eliza heartbreak?
