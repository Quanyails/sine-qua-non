# Total Solar Eclipse (2024-04-08) Notes

## Timeline + highlights

Two months before Eclipse Day:

- Worked out travel plans.
- Ordered eclipse glasses (Daystar Laser Cats [Blueier/Purrrpleier] Style Funner Eclipse Solar Eclipse Glasses).

Eclipse Weekend:

- Packed supplies for the weekend.
- Drove out w/ friends to the host city.
- Saw some cool parts of the host city.
- Discussed lots of contingency plans based on weather forecasts. ([meme](https://fma-omakes.tumblr.com/post/24084333862))
- Discussed lots of contingency plans based on traffic congestion. Ended up working out fine.
- NCAA games were there IG.

Eclipse Day:

- Woke up to a morning of clouds and showers, clearing to thin, milky clouds as we approached totality time.
- Watched the eclipse from [the site of NASA's official streaming location](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/08/science/total-solar-eclipse/nasas-watching-the-eclipse-from-cleveland) (link to The New York Times, paywalled). Got some cool photos of the installations there and in the surrounding areas!
- There were a lot of eclipse-related events and vendors around. Unfortunately, all of the eclipse swag was sold out by the time we arrived (\~30 minutes before partial occlusion started).
- There was an eclipse commentator on the premises. He shared scientific and historical information about eclipses, then announced when people should put on/take off their glasses as totality came and went. This made the event very organized.

Partial occlusion:

- The sun's rays felt notably weaker.
- Got a cool view of the sun's [halo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(optical_phenomenon)>).

Totality:

- Upon seeing the gaping hole in the sky, my body trembled and felt weak.
- The sun had a notable, red [solar prominence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence) in the SSW direction.
- Despite us wearing red/green clothes, we didn't notice [the Purkinje effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect).
- The 360-degree sunset effect was nifty.
- I was prepared to be shaken to my core by the fact we're on a lonely rock in the midst of space (like you do in a planetarium presentation), but that feeling never transpired.
- Overall, I found the eclipse perfectly whelming!

After:

- My inner astronomy nerd had its childhood dreams fulfilled. (Meme: [SPAAAAAAACE.](https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Space_Sphere))
- The speakers in the area played music that reminded me of afterparty or movie credits music.
- I felt sad about the event being over and needing to head back to work!
