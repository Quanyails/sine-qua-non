# Art Progression Timeline

Last update: 2024-09-10

## Overview

When I write about art exercises, I document which tools and resources I've used that are new to that exercise. While helpful for identifying incremental improvements, this documentation fails to capture overarching progress. Furthermore, when documenting changes made in each art exercise, it can be challenging to trace the initial point I used a tool/resource, as I only capture what has changed.

This post resolves this issue. With this post, I have a single point of reference on my art progression. Not only does this benefit myself, but this post may also help those looking identify areas of progress in their own art.
