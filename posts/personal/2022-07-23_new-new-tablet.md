# New New Tablet (2022-07-17)

Aha, so that tablet I acquired earlier this month [here](2022-07-04_new-tablet.md)? It has been replaced.

Despite the technological improvements the Huion tablet brought to my workflow, I noticed one glaring bottleneck in my productivity; for every one stroke I wanted to keep, I needed to draw it multiple times to produce that stroke. I consider my hand-eye coordination fine, but the fact the tablet doesn't stay in a fixed place as I use it made drawing strokes slower than it needs to be.

Due to this bottleneck, I decided to upgrade to a display tablet. In particular, the [Huion Kamvas 16 (2021)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M5Y8VJC/) was on sale for Amazon Prime Day for 2022, at 75% of its original cost (the lowest to date), so I ordered one as an upgrade to the prior Huion.

## Observations

- Initially, the display tablet behaved strangely, where, roughly 20% of the time, the stroke it created used 100% pressure capacity. I tried uninstalling all previous tablet drivers and reinstalling the Huion tablet driver, which resolved this issue for a while. However, it resurfaced some time later. I have not yet identified the core issue, but some combination of restarting the tablet, Photoshop, or OS seems to resolve the issue.
  - As an aside, I've found one reference to this issue at [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/ldxe5n/), which seems to indicate that this is an anomaly with the art application, rather than the tablet proper.
- Compared to the previous pen tablet, the display tablet technically has a larger drawing area. However, in practice, much of that drawing area is taken up by the UI elements in your drawing application, so the actual drawing area is much smaller. Indeed, when using Photoshop on the display tablet, I had to reorganize my UI, as otherwise, the screen was too cramped to work with.
- Monitor setup is a dilemma I have yet to work out. I initially hoped to replace one of my existing monitors with the display tablet. However, as it turns out, the lowest the monitor stand reaches is still higher than what is comfortable for drawing. Furthermore, I will not use the display tablet from my lap, due to ergonomics issues. Therefore, at the moment, it seems like the best solution may be to add an additional monitor arm such that it is at a comfortable height and distance for drawing.
