# New Tablet (2022-06-27)

I recently picked up a Huion HS610 from a colleague of mine. Originally, I expected to use as a backup tablet for if and when the Wacom PTZ-630 failed. However, I found it to have beneficial features compared to the Wacom, so I elected to treat the Wacom as the backup instead.

Pros:

- The Huion HS610 is designed for Windows 7 and up, so I experienced no difficulties using it thus far with Adobe Photoshop 2021. In contrast, the Wacom PTZ-630 was designed for Windows XP. As such, it can be clunky to run on modern art software. A major example of a bug I've encountered when using the Wacom was lag when using the Eyedropper tool on Adobe Photoshop 2021, which requires a manual edit to Photoshop user settings to resolve ([1](https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-fix-discussions/-/m-p/10508735)).
- The pressure grading on the Huion is much wider than that of the Wacom. This allows me to draw more expressively. The increased granularity allows me to add more detail to my linearts. In prior drawings, I've often omitted secondary contours because they made the drawing look too "wrinkly". As an aside, this does require me to control pen pressure more carefully than before.

Differences:

- The Huion has a larger surface area, so I need to scale my strokes accordingly to reach the right areas of the screen.
- The Huion has auto-smoothing built in, which makes creating clean linework easier than the raw output of the Wacom. However, this makes it harder to give an art piece rough edges intentionally.
- The driver needed to use the Huion tablet conflicts with the driver needed to use the Wacom tablet. In order to switch between the two devices, I would need to to reinstall the driver, or otherwise manually enable/disable a system file ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/huion/comments/ejypp2/_/)). While inconvenient, this is not a common usage pattern, so I was content to continue using the Huion.
- The Huion has a textured surface, while the Wacom has a smooth surface. For those coming from traditional media, having a textured tablet surface may make adopting a digital tablet easier. For me, however, coming from using a mouse, the Wacom's smooth surface did not feel unintuitive.
- I was not fond of the replacement of nibs as being part of the Huion's standard operating procedure. Continued maintenance is still maintenance, which I would rather optimize out. However, nib replacement seems expected to be an infrequent occurrence, so I cannot pen this as a con just yet.
