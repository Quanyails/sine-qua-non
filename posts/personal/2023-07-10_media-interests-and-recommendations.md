# Media Interests and Recommendations

Last update: 2024-09-26

## Overview

It can be difficult to find media that keeps my attention; in general, I much prefer to invest my time in something productive (or the illusion thereof). Thus, the media that interests me tends to fall under a small set of categories:

- Media that is intellectually subversive.
- Media that offers a rich sense of discovery.
- Media with a mentally stimulating narrative.
- Media with compelling technical qualities.

Below, I have listed works of media I enjoy that fit under one or more of these categories.

Each section is divided into two sections:

- The first section represents the list of works I resonate with.
- The second section represents the list of works I find interesting but don't necessarily resonate with.

I created this post for two purposes:

1. It acts as a reference for people learning about what media I enjoy.
2. It serves as a list of curated recommendations for those with similar interests.

## Media that is intellectually subversive
