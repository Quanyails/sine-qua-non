# Seasonal Affective Disorder Experiences

Over the past several years, I've noticed a worsening of my physical and mental state during the winter months. My mood drops, my energy levels decrease, and my concentration suffers. Often when struggling, my mind will play the same few seconds of background music on repeat in lieu of higher-level thought.

These effects tend to start in October and end in April—roughly six months long. I didn't want to languish in a haze for half of every year, so I had to change something.

The first thing I did was consult my physician. During my regular physical checkup, I described these symptoms to my physician, who diagnosed me with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

## We tried a few treatment options.

We first tried vitamin D. As the lack of exposure to sunlight in the winter months limits vitamin D synthesis, adding vitamin D sounded like a reasonable addition to my lifestyle.

Following physician orders, I grabbed an over-the-counter supply of Vitafusion Multivitamin Gummies and took regular doses. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any difference in symptoms—but the gummies were a nice morning treat, at least.

The next time we met, we tried light therapy. One reason people experience SAD is a decrease in melatonin production in the winter, so stimulating it may prove effective.

I took a few actions in response to this suggestion.

First, I opened the bedroom blinds. While helpful for my sleep schedule, natural sunlight didn't produce noticeable effects on my energy levels or mood.

As that didn't work, I ordered a Carex DL2000 as per recommendation, switching it on for 15 minutes a day before going to work. I didn't notice any effects, either. Eventually, one of the bulbs went out, and the sun lamp took its place as a photography and jigsaw puzzle light.

The next time we met, we tried medication. My physician wrote a prescription for 25 mg of Zoloft to be taken once a day.

Upon starting the prescription, I noticed an immediate change to my mental state. I could focus and absorb knowledge readily, an experience I only recalled from my teenage years. I found it difficult to dwell on dark thoughts at all, so I could check out darker, more unsettling works of media without being fazed.

As I continued using the medication however, I noticed side effects: the grinding of teeth, ringing of ears, involuntary twitches, lethargy (arguably a benefit), and—most importantly—creative inhibition. I value creating things in my spare time, so I didn't want to rely on Zoloft to keep my mood in check. As I weaned off the medication during the spring and summer, I found myself reluctant to return to it during autumn's onset.

## This year, I made a breakthrough (I think).

Critically, I noticed my mind goes fuzzy when leaving an environment with warm air for an environment with cold air. Whether I'm on my way to the grocery store, inside with the thermostat lowered, or swaddled in thick blankets, the persistence of cold air affects my brain's ability to think.

Most significantly, the air in my bedroom was cool. Even if I dressed in warm sleeping clothes, huddled in thick, insulated blankets, and switched on the heating pad under the sheets, all of the warmth generated would be sucked out through the exposed parts of my body. In the end, I would wake up tired and cold anyway.

Back on November 26, 2018, I ordered a Vornado MVH during an Amazon flash sale, used it once, then promptly stopped. It brought the bedroom's temperature up to a comfortable 72 degrees just fine, but it also made the air dusty. Thinking that part was a flaw with the model and imagining it might come in handy in the future, I boxed it.

As it turns out, I shouldn't have.

A few days ago, I dusted off the old Vornado, plugged it in, flipped the switch, and let it hum quietly through the night. The air was dusty the first night, but it cleared up the second and third. Throughout each night, I noticed my head stayed clear as well, and each morning after, I had more energy. I even remember I dreamed—otherwise a rarity during the winter months. Barring my mood, everything seemed to improve. The space heater seemed to work.

## What's the lesson learned?

Sometimes, diagnosing issues can be difficult; in the case of a human body, variables like food, work, hobbies, seasons, and age all push the body in varying ways, making it challenging to pin down a root cause for when that person is feeling 'off'. As we try things and learn, however, we untangle the body's mysteries. Eventually, we can narrow in on a probable cause and, ultimately, resolve the underlying issue.

Sometimes, these issues take multiple years to resolve. Sometimes, these issues can be solved faster thanks to the internet and those willing to share their previous experiences. Even if this anecdote doesn't apply to other people's situations, I still think it's worth sharing. Perhaps, one of these days, this post will come in handy for a stray passerby.
