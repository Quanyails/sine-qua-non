# Emotional Health: My Retrospective

Content warning: emotional abuse

## To unload, briefly

I did not have an emotionally healthy upbringing. I had a mom who raised me from childhood to college graduation in an emotionally toxic environment. Among her many problems (least of which includes arson), she treated her children as her personal accessories, gaslight her children into doing her bidding, and only showed them love when it benefited her. I learned how to be a human being from her example, never knowing until much later I was a victim of emotional abuse.

After graduating from college, I moved out from my parents' place. From there, I was able to unpack my emotional state. Seven years later, I'm in a place where I can speak comfortably and openly about my experiences and, hopefully, help other people develop their own emotional maturity.

The rest of this blog post acts as a compilation of information I've picked up from my experiences growing up in an emotionally abusive environment.

## The emotionally abused mindset

Beliefs:

- When I was a kid, I'd see all of these other happy kids at school and figure they were _really_ good about keeping up appearances outside the house.
- I'd see all of these romances on TV (not even steamy ones) and was surprised how popular this specific fantasy was. Likewise, I was under the impression stuff meant for mature/adult audiences were, like, violent slasher films and figured people grew into that sort of taste.
- Ever get stage fright from everyday social interactions? I assumed people I met on the street were two-faced and secretly judged me when we talked. Afterward, I imagined them secretly picking over every word I said and thinking how bad I was.
- [2024-08-19] I assumed there was some hidden trick to how society worked and people were keeping it a secret from me.
- I assumed everyone who acted friendly wanted to exploit or scam me. Likewise, I assumed everyone who gave me recommendations wanted to sell me something. In general, I had a hard time forging connections with and trusting other people. (However, one friend managed to convince me how they couldn't be deceiving me _years_ into knowing each other.)
- [2024-08-28] I never understood why women would consider dressing in attractive clothing/putting on makeup/etc. when those actions just put them at greater risk at being harassed.
- I thought it was a lot more common for people to "test" other people in conversationâ€”or, in some cases, I was _hoping_ they were testing me.
- [2024-08-21] I would never assume anything about someone's personality seeing how they behaved around other people until they interacted directly with me (given how two-faced people could be).
- [2024-08-29] I never learned how to ask for help since I'd always be shamed for doing so ([source](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OAbmiSXzFrw)).
- [2024-09-06] I had no idea what trauma looked like since there wasn't a day I didn't live through it.
- [2024-09-08] I never liked boisterous characters in works of media because they taught people the wrong lesson. People shouldn't be outspoken, as being so would get you into trouble.
- [2024-09-18] I interpreted all comments that weren't unadulterated praise as passive-aggressive jabs. E.g. "Your drawing looks like character X" = "Why can't you draw anything unique? You're so unoriginal."
- [2024-10-09] I had a romanticized view of what it meant to be popular (i.e. people would finally pay attention to me).
- [2024-12-31] I never took people's advice unless they had substantial outside proof since I assumed they were trying to manipulate me.
- [2025-03-05] I had major performance anxiety whenever I need to prove myself (e.g. if I'm mentoring someone) because I always figured the person observing me sneered at me, judged me, and would make my life hopeless if I made a single mistake.

Behaviors:

- I'd get incensed when people assumed I liked my family and/or that any dislike of them was just teenage rebellion.
- I dreaded the idea of having to raise someone and shoulder even more responsibility.
- I dreaded having to interact with people. Instead, I turned my attention to animated shows, books, and video games. At least there, I could experience worlds in which people were good and kind to one another.
- Likewise, my knowledge of how dialogue was "meant" to work was severely flawed. Dialogue in shows/books/games/etc. are meant to motivate a story, not to be realistic. Trying to talk to people with this experience doesn't go well. I liked the roleplay communities for that reason. It took me a lot of experience just chatting with people to learn otherwise (and I'm still learning!).
- If I felt a surge of emotions (either positive or negative), I had to bottle it up. Getting overly-emotional would draw people's attention, and that would lead to more trouble. Related: this led me to use intellectualization as a coping mechanism.
- [2024-08-10] I always felt guilty when venting to friends because my parents always used me as their personal therapist.
- I gravitated towards sciences over humanities since the latter was subjective. I had to cultivate a picture of perfection, lest someone find a vulnerability and attack it incessantly until I was broken.
- [2024-10-28] I was afraid to leave my internet presence out of a fear that someone would stalk me and steal my personal data.
- [2024-11-13] I'm afraid of breaking bad news to people out of a fear that they'll lash out at me for doing so.
- [2024-11-13] I had a crippling insecurity of being judged as disappointing, lazy, and useless if I ever cancelled a commitment or stopped participating in an activity.
- [2024-12-20] I never cared about what people wore because I knew that physical appearances could be deceiving.
- [2025-02-02] Likewise, I hated when people judged me for the clothes I wore. I associated fashion with being deceptive and superficial.
- [2025-02-02] I always felt the need to explain myself when speaking because people would always cherry-pick my words for their benefit instead of trying to understand me honestly.
- [2025-02-02] I could never enjoy doing something for myself because people would guilt-trip me into thinking I was disappointing and selfish.
- [2025-02-17] I found it hard to step out and do activities unless I knew they would benefit me exactly the way I wanted. Without realizing it, I was applying my perfectionism to how I lived day-to-day.
- [2025-03-14] I was afraid of joining new communities online because I was afraid they were filled with the creeps, manipulators, and scammers I was so used to, as opposed to regular, friendly people.
- [2025-03-14] I never put 100% effort into anything. This was because I was always told I could do better, so I was afraid what would happen if I did my best and it wasn't enough.
- [2025-03-25] I had a hard time doing basic household tasks because my parents always turned it into a chore I _had_ to do. In order to, say, feel comfortable cooking for myself, I had to find an environment where people were all comfortable learning and sharing their own results without shaming.
- [2025-04-12] I learned to never be angry with people, even when I should have. This was out of an aversion to employing any behaviors my abuser employed.

Interactions:

- [2024-07-16] I never learned how to speak up for myself (or at all) because none of my objections mattered. Likewise, I never interrupted conversations and instead just sat there in silence waiting for them to finish.
- [2024-11-21] I never explained my thought processes because they would be taken as an excuse instead of something valid.
- [2024-07-23] I would never be 100% clear when explaining myself, since the only outcome would be that my words would be twisted irrevocably beyond its intent.
- [2024-07-24] I was never comfortable asking for help. I feared being weak and/or people "helping" by taking advantage of me.
- [2024-08-10] I was overly apologetic and didn't know how to respond to apologies because no one apologized to me.
- [2024-08-19] I had a hard time listening to others because I didn't want to be taken advantage of. At the same time, I wanted people to know I was special so people would treat me kindly.
- [2024-08-25] I was conflict-avoidant and easily bent to peer pressure out of a fear of being abandoned.
- [2024-08-30] I could never share my interests with people because I would forever be defined by that one interest, no matter how much I say I changed. I could never wear branded clothing or add accessories to my person.
- [2024-09-16] I hated admitting someone was right because that person would lord over their victory over me for the rest of time and use it as a weapon against me.
- [2024-09-17] I treated everyone with undue fairness because I grew up in an unfair environment, even if that meant sacrificing my own needs for their sake.
- [2024-10-02] I have a hard time saying "no" to people because people didn't accept "no" as an answer.
- I never saw validation for my emotional state, so in turn, I don't always recognize other people's emotional cues.
- It was difficult for me to identify emotionally manipulative people. I'd latch onto people who people lovebombed me, and then I'd be confused when they no longer wanted to hang out later. In return, I engaged in emotionally manipulative behavior (mostly possessiveness), not knowing it was wrong.

Actions:

- I couldn't get involved in things if they offered any chance someone might shame it. I had to draw portfolio-style art (no anime, comics, fanart, etc.), I had to avoid boorish, lowbrow music.
- [2024-08-25] I never spoke up or asked questions because any response to the contrary would be perceived as disobedience.
- [2024-08-19] I had a hard time throwing away and/or destroying things because it was common for my possessions to be thrown away as punishment. I still struggle to do things like cracking an egg.
- [2024-10-02] I enjoy thrifting because I sympathize with being a hidden gem among trash.
- [2024-10-09] I detested competitions since I was afraid of being punished if I didn't win. This also made me a sore loser.
- [2025-03-14] I could never pick up useful skills because people would then rely on me for that skill, blaming me if anything went wrong.
- [2025-04-12] I was ashamed of crying, as other people berated me for being week if I did so.

Sense of self/interests:

- My value as a human being was tied to what I could do for others. The only way to raise my self-esteem was for me to be helpful. If, for instance, someone criticized the art I made, I took it as an attack on me as the artist.
- Likewise, I kept craving other people's validation because I didn't know how to love myself. It took a very good friend who liked me for who I was (outside of anything we did together) for me to learn how to pick myself up.
- I fetishized character-driven narratives, as I indulged in the idea that characters can have a change of heart and grow into better human beings. I loved Byronic protagonists and emotionally sympathetic antagonists because I wanted to see them heal. Also, I liked edgelord characters because they could convert emotional pain into something cool.
- [2024-07-07] I was enamored with the trope of characters who could fundamentally replace their identity. Whether it be through corruption, demonic possession, a split personality, or otherwise, I craved the idea that people would accept you as someone besides the identity that was thrust onto you.
- [2024-07-24] I enjoyed the trope of characters who shared a body. Whether it be through mind control, possession, a split personality, or otherwise, I wanted a friend who understood and could help you get through everything.
