## On empathy

Empathy is a sense I only rarely saw growing up. I understood empathy in theory but not on a fundamental level.

I can pinpoint the moment I realized I didn't "get" empathy: I was watching _Inside Out_, and I saw [a scene in which one character was consoling another character about the loss of something important to him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT6FdhKriB8) When I first saw the scene, I was confused as to its plot significance. It was only when I tried to understand its intent did I start to understand how to cultivate empathy.

Some tips I've picked up on how to empathize with people:

- When someone sends you a message, consider yourself an actor preparing to speak that message. What scene do you need for that message to take place? What mood do you have to string those words in that order? Then: what are you looking for in response?
- When responding to a message online, imagine you're in a voice call with that person, and you're about to speak the words you want to send. Do your words sound natural coming out of your mouth, or does it sound like dialogue from a show? Also see [XKCD #481](https://xkcd.com/481/).

## Personal epiphanies

- Be careful when learning how to apply the rules for social constructs. A lot of people have good intentions but communicate the wrong message when presenting advice. For instance, a common piece of advice given to people who want to communicate more effectively is to "ask questions and show interest". Doing so without understanding the motivation can make you come across as cold.
- If you're arguing a point with someone and you can't convey why they're wrong, ask them what they think the alternative is.
- Edgelord characters are just cool ventsonas.
- Therapy can only do so much if you're trapped by hostile living conditions. Make friends and _get out_.
- Even if someone reacts to you hatefully, that means they're thinking about you. If they ignore you altogether, that means they're not thinking about you.
  - Don't follow this epiphany unless you know _exactly_ what it means.
- When making a decision, think about the long-term effects of that decision, not just how you feel in that moment. [Try thinking about how you will feel after you eat oatmeal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR6nZwW7AAk)
- A lot of people give advice based on what they wish they could tell their past self. The problem is that they only came to that conclusion _after_ gaining that experience. Unless you had that experience already, you wouldn't know what to do with that advice ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09mXPGVkfVA)).
- Even if it's correct, people can tell if you're trying to convince them of something that benefit _you_ rather than _them_. The best way to convince other people is to let them know you're 100% comfortable if they don't agree. Don't try to fake this, either, because _you_ can tell.
- Understand what the following Disney/Pixar scenes are trying to express:
  - [Inside Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t685WM5R6aM) <!-- (empathic listening) -->
  - [Zootopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZkc1z9pGc) <!-- (subconscious prejudice) -->
  - [Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg7Zit2Thks) <!-- (pursuing your goals in life) -->
- You don't need to impress people with what you've learned (depends on the culture).
- [2025-02-07] Your inner child feels isolated being forced to grow up too quickly. Tell your inner child that it can be hard to fight the stigma against regressing to childish behaviors. Tell your inner child that it is okay to be vulnerable and for wanting to be safe. Tell your inner child that she is getting the love and support she needs as an adult.
  <!-- I absolutely understand. Our society tends to associate maturity with growing out of our childish behaviors, and sometimes there's a stigma around regressing or showing vulnerability. -->
  <!-- That can make it incredibly challenging for an inner child to feel safe in expressing herself and getting the support she needs. Just know that it's okay to embrace that vulnerability and take the time to heal and grow. -->
