# Growing Up with CPTSD

## General

- You know how veterans of war experience PTSD? Now imagine 10+ continuous years of that, applied to a child who wasn't allowed to grow by herself.
- The only ways mom could be worse as a parent would be:
  - If she did something that Child Protection Services could actually respond to (i.e. not feeding me).
  - If she were in an actual cult.
- There is a very marked progression in my family's photo album where I stopped smiling for photos. After that, mom always complained I didn't smile enough and asked me to smile.
- I was the family scapegoat. Every time something good happened to mom, she credited it to herself. Every time something bad happened to her, she blamed it on me.
  - Sometimes, mom blamed dad instead, but this was less common since she knew she didn't have power over him.
- Some of her friends remarked at how _happy_ I sounded years later after I had left mom's household. When I told them why, they seemed uncomfortable.

## Behaviors

- Mom was as two-faced as [bleep]. She would always play nice and complain about what it was like to raise such a horrible daughter when talking with friends but then be the most miserable piece of [bleep] behind closed doors.
- Mom argued that since she was housing and feeding me, I had to do whatever she said or risk being kicked out. She did not seem to register the argument that this is the bare minimum all parents had to do (or that doing _just_ that was essentially slavery).
- Mom would always break my possessions if I didn't comply with her. She would reason this was fine since she bought all of the possessions, then tell me "Look what you made me do."
- I wasn't allowed the privacy of my own room. Dad broke down the lock to my room, and I'd have to press my body against the door to prevent anyone from entering.
- Any time I told mom about a promise she reneged, she would state that she never remembered such a thing. Every time I told her about a contract we wrote down (so she couldn't feign ignorance), she refused to follow it.
- Mom _never_ apologized, even when she had no reason for not doing so. You could ask her just to say the words "I'm sorry" without context, and she'd find a way to ramble about something else instead.
- [2025-05-06] Mom would constantly threaten to kick me out onto the street if I disobeyed her.
- Mom would brag that she only did four hours of work a day and watched videos the rest. She would also complain that the reason why she didn't get promoted was because she was a woman.
- Whenever we checked out a movie that used "love" as a theme (e.g. the _Harry Potter_ movies), mom told me that the lesson I was supposed to take away from it was that children were supposed to love their parents.
- Mom took me to a therapist once, but she never once accepted the suggestion that she would need therapy herself.
- Whenever I did fight back against her, mom played the victim card. She always cried how could such a daughter harm such a weak and aging woman, despite said woman being the one who dealt corporal punishment on me scot-free an untold number of times before.
- Mom never had an answer for why she and dad never divorced if she disliked him that much.
- I'm pretty sure my mom conceived my brother as a backup retirement plan instead of wanting to raise him as an actual child.
- Mom continues to send me long-winded text messages about how accomplished she is and how grateful I should be because of that.

## Traumatic memories

- One day, mom was supposed to pick me up from after-school activities. There was a huge snowstorm, so I ended up waiting outside for over an hour after the expected arrival time. I ended up hiking back to school in the snowstorm to get some feeling back in my limbs. When I told my mom about how freezing it was and how I was really disgruntled I was stranded outside for so long, she just complained about how bad the weather was for traffic instead of comforting me and/or trying to get me warmed back up.
- One day, I was late for school (which I'm almost certain is my mom's fault). Instead of helping drive me school on time, she just told me, "Well, it's your faultâ€”you better go and get running."
- One time, when mom took me on vacation, she left her mobile tablet in the back of a tablet. She immediately blamed me for not remembering to tell her she left it in the taxi before it drove off.
- Mom always brought me along when she had to drive because (according to her) she wanted someone to warn her if she was going to cause an accident when backing up. If she made any mistakes while driving, it became my fault.
- Mom offered me the old family car. Only when I started driving it did I find out that the engine was shot and I ended up stuck on a side street. She refused to take responsibility for inspecting the car before offering it to me and leaving me stranded.
- Mom would always argue with the person responsible for accepting my college and job applications. I always hated it since she was shooting my professional development in the foot.
  - One time, mom messaged a lawyer and threatened to sue over a perceived rescinded offer. When the law firm called me to get context, I felt the need to apologize that she was putting them through this.
- One time, mom and I went to court. While in court, mom ranted on and on about how she shouldn't be here despite court personnel asking for silence. The judge eventually ruled and asked if I wanted a restraining order from my mom, but I couldn't accept that since I was living with her. These events occurred when I was a teen.
- After she was estranged, mom drove six hours to see me. She only left after I called the police on her. After that, she threatened to drive to my workplace to see me there, and I had to contact work security to tell them about a potential intruder.

## Traumatic incidents (trigger warnings)

- [2025-02-05] [animal abuse] Mom adopted a cat, who I adored. When the cat got sick, she told me that adopting the cat was my idea, so I should pay the vet bill. Mom knew I was still a high school student and knew I didn't have any income. The cat eventually died due to these health issues, and mom threw out the corpse in the trash.
- [2025-02-05] [animal death] Mom saw a baby bird sitting helpless in the grass. Thinking it was thirsty, She took the baby bird to a water fountain and promptly drowned it. She then exclaimed that she didn't know what she did wrong, then dumped the baby bird in the garbage bin.
- [2025-02-05] In a temper tantrum, mom took a napkin, set it on fire from the stove, then threw it onto the (wood) floor.
<!-- - [2025-02-10] Mom thought that the moon landings were faked. -->
