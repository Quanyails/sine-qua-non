# Self-Care Notes

(Followed up from [Seasonal Affective Disorder Experiences](../mental-health/2023-10-21_seasonal-affective-disorder-experiences.md).)

[2024-02-09] Breakthroughs:

- It turns out vitamin D _does_ have an effect of me. The issue instead was the dosage. 1000 IU/day didn't produce a noticeable effect, but increasing the dosage to 3000 IU/day did.
- Nice smells and flavors help stimulate me on a winter day. Examples of scents and flavors that help me include eucalyptus and green onion.
- Taking Zoloft for a season helps to rewire your mind. I can't argue for extended use, but using it for some time helped.

[2024-04-21] A compilation of things that have helped the quality of my sleep:

- A thick wool blanket insulates me.
- A large squishy pillow rejuvenates me more than a firm pillow does.
- A quiet space heater ensures I'm not too cold in bed ([DeLonghi TRH0715](https://www.delonghi.com/en-us/p/TRH0715-6A)).
- A high-quality sleeping mask blocks light from outside.
- Sleeping in appropriate sleepwear makes me comfortable.

Subsequent notes:

- [2024-04-20] Installing a dimmer switch helps my transition to darkness.
- [2024-04-20] Installing blackout curtains reduces the amount of light entering the bedroom (inspired by [Dr. Glaucomflecken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ77ivVbI_8)).
- Sun lamps and daylight-temperature bulbs to tell my body when I should be awake (see [GE Ultra Bright LED 150-Watt EQ PAR30 Long Neck Daylight Medium Base (e-26) Dimmable LED Light Bulb](https://www.lowes.com/pd/-/5014247279)).
- [2024-08-10] Making my bed in the morning, now that I was looking forward to a good night's rest.
- [2024-09-06] Waking up early and doing something meaningful before the work day starts sets the pace for the day.
- [2024-09-08] Control the number of interruptions you experience to better manage your time. For me, removing myself from Create-a-Pokemon, Discord notifications, Pokemon Go, and SRE-related roles gave me precious focus time back.
- [2024-09-08] Filter out noise from your life. If your feed is filled with too much noise, you'll filter it out altogether and never fill your head with meaningful stuff.
- [2024-09-13] Partaking in a palette puzzle reoriented my mind to function less asynchronously and more synchronously.
- [2024-09-17] Set hard limits on sleep. This includes distractions from your roommate(s).
- [2024-09-24] Be aware if you are experiencing [revenge bedtime procrastination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedtime_procrastination). This typically means you are overstressed and don't have enough time after studying/work to destress. This can be very dangerous for your mental health.
- [2024-09-27] Catsitting was a short-term commitment, as it gives me something to look forward to every day, improving my emotional state.
- [2024-11-21] Cleaning the house does wonders for one's focus. Given I've lived with a roommate for multiple years, I've had limited control over my living space. Being more assertive about cleaning stuff out helps.
<!-- - [2025-01-05] Look into daylight therapy lamps. [Optimize Your Biology](https://optimizeyourbiology.com/light-therapy-lamp-database) provides a fairly robust analysis of available options. --> 
- [2025-01-05] Make sure the ambient temperature of your living space is tolerable. Too low a temperature saps energy.
- [2025-02-04] You can't practice mindfulness if 1. you don't have the energy for it and if you aren't given the space for it (e.g. if your home environment doesn't allow for it). Fix your energy levels first, then your home environment.
- [2025-05-06] Clean out space. If you don't have control over your own space, you get really easily distracted by your environment. Over time, this wears down on your energy and focus.
- [2024-03-25] After a lifetime of being told my hobbies are childish or cringe, reconnecting with these hobbies heals the inner child. An example activity I found soothing is to play old Flash games such as _Tasty Planet_.
