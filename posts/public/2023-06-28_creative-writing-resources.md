When browsing the following resources, keep in mind that these said resources are targeted towards novices seeking to learn about the craft. As such, they may seem elementary to more experienced writers.

## Resources

- [10 Best AI Novel Writing Software Tools for 2022](https://yourlifestylebusiness.com/ai-novel-writing-software/):
  - [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/): AI-powered syntax checker. This tool is useful for catching errors a standard spellchecker may miss. However, when submitting prose, take its suggestions with a grain of salt.
  - [InferKit](https://app.inferkit.com/demo): AI-powered autocomplete with support for prose. This model does not produce the most vivid prose out of the options available, but it is free with limitations and fairly stable, making it helpful for generating narrative inspiration.
  - [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) (paid): While commonly used for text adventure prompts, the model can be fine-tuned to generate complex and frighteningly competent prose. The AI model generates vivid imagery, inspired figures of speech, and clever continuations for narratives. I use this tool as a co-author, and I often find myself frustrated I can't incorporate more of its ideas into my predefined narrative.
    - For _Shaved Ice_, I used this configuration: AI Model = Krake, AI Module = Theme: Urban Fantasy, Config Preset: Reverie
  - [WordTune](https://www.wordtune.com/): AI-powered fine-tuner. I find it to be a reliable tool for finding the exact word you need in a sentence when you can't think of it.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com): General-purpose AI-powered chatbot. Helpful as a reverse dictionary, thesaurus, or idea generator.
- [The Emotion Thesaurus: A Writer's Guide To Character Expression - Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Emotion-Thesaurus-Writers-Character-Expression/dp/0999296345): Thorough cheat sheet for writing emotional cues.
- [How to Show, not Tell: The Complete Writing Guide](https://quotidianwriter.medium.com/45cb72f02541): In-depth article on the often-repeated adage of "show, don't tell". I find it helpful the article provides examples of what to do and not do.
- @introvert-unicorn tag: [writing tips](https://introvert-unicorn.tumblr.com/archive/tagged/writing%20tips): Collection of inspirational writing posts.
- [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/): Wiki that catalogs as many tropes as possible as seen across media. Helpful as inspiration for finding tropes and media that uses these tropes.
- [WordHippo](https://www.wordhippo.com/): Thesaurus. Compared to other thesaurus options, WordHippo has an excellent balance between thoroughness and accuracy.

## Tips (General)

- You don't need to develop a script as a comprehensive sequence of events from beginning to end. Instead, it can be easier to write down as many events as possible and leave gaps to resolve those later. The more you write, the more you realize what the story is trying to accomplish, and the easier it is to fill in those gaps after hitting your stride.
- The mood of the writer often affects the way characters are written. If left unaddressed, this can lead to inconsistent characterization between writing sessions. When starting a writing session, I find it helpful to review a list of the key traits of each character, as well example gestures, quotes, or scenes, to help ground my mental perception of my characters.
- The Butterfly Effect applies to storytelling. Tweaking a character's personality even slightly can drastically change how he or she reacts to a later event, diverting the narrative timeline entirely. If you have a predefined end goal for your story, you need to ensure that the plot points you set up continue to point to it.
  - Aside: Metaphorically, the process reminds me of finding the exact angle one should shine a light through a crystal such that it refracts at the proper angle out.
- Don't get too attached any particular part of your story. There are times where you write a brilliant line of prose and want to show it off in the story, but the line doesn't mesh with the story's context. The story comes first. Save the line in another document. With any luck, you'll be able to revive the line in another context.

- Take breaks. It is easy to reach semantic satiation when editing the same lines repeatedly. Spending time on another hobby helps ensure that your mind will be fresh when you next revisit the text.
- If possible, determine how wide your pages will be. The width of your story's pages controls the speed at which readers will read the story. You will want to ensure that the reading experience is paced accordingly.
- Experience transfers between other creative processes and writing. In my case, such experience comes from the form of digital art:
  - "Use references" is a suggestion that is often repeated to artists when creating. In practice, I have found that this suggestion applicable to writing. When you reference an image or video of a subject when writing, the prose you produce becomes more vivid than when you generate the equivalent imagery from memory.
  - The process of building up a narrative mirrors the process of rendering an illustration. In both cases, you start with a skeleton of the final product you're trying to produce, then iteratively add more details to it until you reach the final result. (This method is called the Snowflake Method in some circles.)
  - Aside: In the past, I would try to write a full, compelling narrative one pass. After all, that was what I saw in the literature I read. If this were art, however, this process would be akin to the process of starting from a blank canvas and rendering a full illustration from top to bottom. This is an absurd task compared to developing a piece layer by layer, so I am grateful for my past experience in understanding how to best develop a work.
- Don't stress over developing a summary of your story early. While it is helpful to have an elevator pitch for when someone asks what your story is about, said pitch may not stay relevant. As your story coheres, the overarching narrative of your story tends to reveal itself.
  - If you're still struggling to summarize your story despite it being mostly cohesive, [try asking your characters what they think the story is about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D5jvZbyA98). [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)—or summarizing, as the case may be—can often be helpful for putting thoughts into words.

## Tips (Specific)

- When showing silence in a scene, it is often helpful to show the idle happenings in the scene instead of focusing on the silence itself ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/6blzfu/)). Describing moments through idle occurrences produces richer imagery than describing silence, while maintaining the scene's pace.
