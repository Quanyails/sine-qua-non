# Obscure and Lost Media - Music

## Overview

This post lists works I'm interested in that, over time, have become obscure.

---

**Name**: A Knight To Remember (published by Alfred Music)
<br>
**Released**: [1998-06-01](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/076926056X)
<br>
**Search result hits (Google)**: 12
<br>
**Lost?** Partially.

- A "musical pack" of the songs in the play [is available for purchase](https://www.jwpepper.com/3147519.item), but the full script is out of print and unavailable online.
- A purchase page for the Teacher's Guide, containing the cover art of the play, can be viewed [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/076926056X).
- Recordings of the play can be found on YouTube at ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUm_BXYKWfI), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhRvbOcpIQ), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ-30-qERzQ)).
- I would be interested in the original script as a PDF!

**Name**: Candylusional (Flashygoodness)
<br>
**Released**: [2009-05-17 or earlier](https://www.deviantart.com/cravat-guy/art/-122803231)
<br>
**Search result hits (Google)**: 13
<br>
**Lost?** Partially.

- Flashygoodness's DeviantArt page is defunct and has been [explicitly excluded from the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/flashygoodness.deviantart.com).
- [A quick search of "Candylusional" on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/search?q=Candylusional) brings up references to the track, and many pages include links to dead pages such as:
  - [1](https://flashygoodness.deviantart.com/art/Candylusional-Dance-Mix-111547120)
  - [2](https://flashygoodness.deviantart.com/art/Flashy-Music-Gallery-v0-4-beta-117339174)
  - [3](https://flashygoodness.deviantart.com/art/Candylusional-Collection-122971838)
- Flashygoodness hosted a music player containing all "Candylusional" mixes, but only a few mixes seem to survive:
  - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv7hUvi9Kcg)
  - [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vou0DqwsiUo)
  - [3](https://soundcloud.com/oniburei/flashygoodness-sweetest-notes-piano-section)
- Additionally, one of Flashygoodness's tracks was coupled with a Flash animation of his characters, Ange-Pon and Devi-Pon, who would bop along with the track. When the viewer typed "flashygoodness" in, Hanabi(?) would appear and dance to the rhythm, while Ange-Pon sung along.
  - Character names were taken from the description from [this fan art](https://www.deviantart.com/cyberfire22/art/-124078689).
- Bonus: I found a mirror of ["Pyrotechnic Perennial X"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H960PcaKob0) while searching for references to "Candylusional". This appears to be another lost track of Flashygoodness.

- The keyboard itself is no longer produced, and no official MIDI or songbook exists for the track. [The owner's manual](https://usa.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/9/319469/psr170.pdf) only lists the song as "Demo Song", with no composer attached to the track.
- Recordings of the song exist on YouTube ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SgAma9SS2Y&t=71s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EncIsAEOFXk&t=30s) [partial], [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU2K2wvKg04&t=210s)).
- I would be interested in the track as a MIDI or PDF!
