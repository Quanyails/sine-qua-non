    - Color Dodge layers can be effective for use with subsurface scattering (chapter 1, 52:44).
    - Save adding in brightest highlights and darkest occlusion for the very end, when you really need to make the piece stand out. Until then, vary your midtones instead (chapter 2, part 3, 4:07). This strengthens your piece from big elements to small elements.

## Specific Tips - Coloring/Lighting/Shading

- [Character Portrait Illustration Workflow (Video Tutorial)](https://www.clipstudio.net/how-to-draw/archives/170075): Use "gouache blender" for textured blending.
- [2024-09-27] [Color and Light by James Gurney](https://archive.org/details/color-and-light-james-gurney-english):
  - Consciously restrict your palette to a subset of the color wheel when planning compositions (128).
  - Colors shouldn't be drawn standalone in sequential art. Consider how the palette changes from image to image in the sequence (132).
  - Purkinje shift: Rods are sensitive to greenish gues, so reds are less visible in dim lighting conditions (138).
  - Use perceptive blurring to mimic the human eye changing focus as it moves through a scene (140 – 141).
  - "When sunlight travels through a thin, semitransparent material, the light becomes richly colored. Light that bounces off the surface is fairly dull by comparison. This 'stained-glass window effect' is called transmitted light." (152)
  - Subsurface scattering: Objects are illuminated more where it's thinner, as less light gets absorbed. This effect only occurs with backlighting (154).
  - Caustics only form in shallow water (161).
  - Caustics can be formed reflected up (161).
  - Sky gets paler/greener towards the horizon (174 – 175).
  - Dark objects become bluer/grayer toward the horizon because of atmospheric obstruction. Light objects become warmer due to ??? (176).
  - "Golden hours" occur due to heavy moisture in the air at low-angle suns (178).
  - Composition ideas: light foreground, dark midground, light background (196 – 197).

- Personal:
  - Be liberal in your use of technology! In traditional art, you only have one layer. In digital art, you can use multiple layers. In traditional art, erasers leave residue. In digital art, erasers are perfect. Don't be afraid of drawing extra, overlapping shapes just so you can get the proper composition.
  - There's a logical reason to why hands are hard to draw! If you count the number of articulated joints in a hand, you'll end up with 3 × 5 = 15 on each finger. If you count the number of articulated joints in the body, you'll end up with 14 or so (neck, shoulder × 2, elbow × 2, wrist × 2, spine, hip × 2, knee × 2, ankle × 2). There are more points of articulation in a single hand than there are in the rest of the body, so it's easy to draw one incorrectly in a way that makes the entire hand look wrong.

## Specific Tips - Design Elements

- [Drawing Water - Basic and Fundamentals](https://tips.clip-studio.com/en-us/articles/6224):
  - The deeper the water, the deeper blue it is because of how much blue light is being reflected.

  - Water is less reflective the closer it is to you b/c of viewing angle (i.e. the Fresnel effect).
  - Water physics (e.g. displacement).
