# Vograce Notes

- When you place an order, Vograce allows you to customize elements of your order beyond the options offered through menus. The degree of customization offered this way is inconsistent, however. You can customize elements such as the charm accessory or packaging material. However, you can't customize elements such as the size of each charm within that batch.
- When producing a batch of charms, Vograce does not respect the relative size of the input images. If you order a charm with at 1000 px and another at 2000 px, they will be produced at the same physical size.
- The charms come with a protective film on their backside.
