## Overview

2D animation exercises.

## Design notes

- Software: Clip Studio Paint EX 4.0
- #8:
  - Inspired by the animation resources I'm following, I attempted to use smear frames.
  - Everything is an arc! I need to build up my animations from fundamentals instead of drawing each frame straight-head as the naive approach would be.
  - I learned much about how musculature works from drawing how a malleable mass shifts around.
- #9/#10:
  - I attempted to incorporate squash and stretch as the flour sack descended from the top of its arc.
  - While not on the exercise agenda, I practiced adding secondary motion.
  - I incorporated a few lines to act as a rudimentary background.
  - In contrast to a pivot-style approach, an [inverse kinematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics)-style approach seems superior in producing convincing animation results.
